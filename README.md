# References

## Basic Info

- Repo URL 
[Repo URL:  This one](https://github.com/granierregis/MSSE640-2025summer.git)

- How to find out the remote repo
```
$ git remote -v
origin  https://granierregis@github.com/granierregis/MSSE640-2025summer.git (fetch)
origin  https://granierregis@github.com/granierregis/MSSE640-2025summer.git (push)
```

## Local and global config
- If using multiple GitHub accounts, I recommend ensuring that all of your config info is local
```
$ git config --list --local
git config --list --global
```

### You should always use the local config option if you want to access multiple Git Hub accounts from the same computer

- Basic global config setup (Before first commit)
```
git config --global user.email "<email>"
git config --global user.name "<First Last>"

```
- Basic local config setup (Before first commit)

```
git config --local user.email "<email>"
git config --local user.name "<First Last>"

```

### If have trouble using multiple accounts from the same computer
- Including the correct username for the repo in the remote. 
- Credential helper will often cache one username and it will use that by default when you attempt 
to use another repo where that username is not correct. 

#### Example
```
git remote add origin https://granierregis@github.com/granierregis/MSSE640-2025summer.git
```
